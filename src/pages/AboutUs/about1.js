      At Facet, we believe in the democratrisation of choice. Get involved in
      bringing the content you want to watch to life. Stories on urgent issues
      such as climate change, mental health or inequality need to be told and
      can be easily overlooked by data algorithms currently picking the next
      hit.

      Facet is a content financing platform where curated fiction and
      non-fiction film, web and TV projects are offered to accredited investors
      as well as the broader public -helping you pick the next hit.

      <br />
      Content investing is exciting because everyone has the same objective: to
      tell the story. Our projects offer potential financial returns to
      investors alongside measurable impact - accredited investors can support
      projects via short-term loans and we also offer rewards-based financing
      options. Campaigns will have an upper limit of â‚¬500,000.
      <br />
      <br />
      We believe that building relationships between creators and investors
      increases the chances for success and aim to remove the hassle!
